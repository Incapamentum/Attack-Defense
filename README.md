# Single-Core Cache Timing Side Channel Attack
A single-core implementation of a cache timing side channel attack making use of the Prime+Probe exploit. 

Completed as part of a Spring 2021 term project for the special topics course EEL 5937 - Attacks & Defenses in Secure Architectures. Class instructor is Dr. Fan Yao.

The paper by Liu et. al [1] served as the main motivation in pursuing this term project.

## III. Software Tools

The following pieces of software were used in the development of this project. Unless otherwise noted, all software is open-sourced and used as-is.

### [Cache Template Attacks](https://github.com/IAIK/cache_template_attacks)

GitHub repository containing tools that can be used to perform [Cache Template Attacks](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/gruss).

### [Mastik: A Micro-Architectural Side-Channel Toolkit](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~yval/Mastik/)

Provides robust implementations of side-channel attack techniques. It implements six side-channel attacks:

+ Prime+Probe on L1 data cache
+ Prime+Probe on L1 instruction cache
+ Pribe+Probe on last-level cache
+ Flush+Reload
+ Flush+Flush
+ Performance degredation attack
